CycloneDX Webpack Plugin
=========

The CycloneDX plugin for Webpack creates a valid CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) containing an aggregate of 
all bundled dependencies. This plugin uses the linkages generated by webpack to create a dependency graph which only 
contain the dependencies that are actually used. 

Requirements
-------------------
- Node.js v8.0.0 or higher
- Webpack v4.0.0 or higher

Usage
-------------------

#### Installing

```bash
npm i -D @cyclonedx/webpack-plugin
```


#### Example
In your [webpack config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) add the CycloneDX plugin:
```js
const { CycloneDxWebpackPlugin } = require('@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  ...

  plugins: [
    new CycloneDxWebpackPlugin({
      context: '../',
      outputLocation: './artifacts'
    })
  ]
};
```

#### Support for IETF /.well-known/sbom
The CycloneDX Webpack plugin supports placing the CycloneDX SBOM in a pre-defined location, specifically in
`/.well-known/sbom`. This option is enabled by default. The behavior can be changed by overriding the values 
of `includeWellknown` and `wellknownLocation`.

> See [draft-lear-opsawg-sbom-access](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-opsawg-sbom-access) for more 
> information on the specification, currently an IETF draft.

In your [webpack config](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/) add the CycloneDX plugin:
```js
const { CycloneDxWebpackPlugin } = require('@cyclonedx/webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  ...

  plugins: [
    new CycloneDxWebpackPlugin({
      context: '../',
      outputLocation: './artifacts',
      includeWellknown: true,
      wellknownLocation: './.well-known/sbom'
    })
  ]
};
```
