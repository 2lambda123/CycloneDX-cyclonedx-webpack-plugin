  * Requires _webpack_ version `^5` as a `peerDependency`, was `>=4 <6`.
* Changed
  * The optional configuration options changed in name and meaning. Consult the `README` for details.
* Added
  * Added an optional switch to select the desired CycloneDX spec version for the output.  
    The value currently defaults to `'1.4'`. (fixes [#53] via [#70])
  * Full support for typing. This will make the configuration of this plugin easier.
  * Lots of small features got added due to the fact that the data processing is managed by  `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library` now.
* Fixed
  * Dependency graph no longer has `null` or `undefined` values. (fixes [#31] via [#70])
* Removed

    You may use _webpack_'s `--stats` switch instead.
* Misc
  * Uses `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library` now, instead of `@cyclonedx/bom`.
